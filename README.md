Be carefull with the Synch_To directory the script deletes ALL files that are not similier to the Synch_From directory!

Short Info:
  What does this script?
    -The script is thought to synch two directorys or whatever you want.
  How to use it?
    -To use it correctly you have to change the 3 paths at the top of the script. (Called: Synch_From, Synch_From, Safe_Log)
    -You also need a python interpreter and the at the button mentioned pip projects. (Technicly required)
    -Make sure that your user has the rights to change/delete the directorys and files!
    
Required python projects:
  -Pandas   --> see https://pypi.org/project/pandas/   to install
  -Ipython  --> see https://pypi.org/project/ipython/  to install
  -Datetime --> see https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/ to install

Don't want to synch every directory?
  -The script ignores every file or directory that contains "DONT_SYNCH_DIR". (Either the copy from directory and the copy to directory) 

Enjoy (:
